##VideoJS API Documentation

Brightcove is the main sponsor of the [VideoJS project](http://videojs.com/), employing many of the core members and investing engineering hours in improving the player and video.js plugins. The Brightcove Player is built on video.js and used on thousands of video websites, ensuring video.js can handle the most professional use cases.

The [Video.js API](http://docs.videojs.com/docs/guides/api.html) allows you to interact with the video through JavaScript, whether the browser is playing the video through HTML5 video, Flash, or any other supported playback technologies.

There is an [API Documentation Index](http://docs.videojs.com/docs/api/index.html) with the basic instructions of this API.
